# The Dumbest Random Username Generator

## Description
Welcome to the most useless piece of entertainment that the world never asked for!
Are you tired of writing out your own seed or dummy data?
Sick of having ChatGPT generate a ton of *boring* uninteresting user data?

Well, look no further than the random username generator! 
An awful chimera of peculiar words and amusing nouns that probably only I will find funny, birthed from significant lack of sleep and trembling caffiene addled fingers, I bring you this monstrosity.

For all those who say, "Don't waste time on dummy data," *this* is my obstinate shriek of defiance.
I have made this purely for **fun** and **amusement**!

For those of you who find dummy data obnoxious, boring, or exceedingly **UN**-fun, please reap my strange machinations to your benefit and add a little pizzaz or spice to your project.
In fact, having strange usernames or odd posts might give your live demo the unforgettable *zing* that it needs!

>>**NOTE:** This originally was intended to be strictly usernames, but I've decided in this very moment to extend it to include all sorts of basic dummy data. There will be options to filter data based on your needs and to exclude swears and lightly inappropriate/off color humor. 

## Dependencies
This piece of garbage is written in Node.js and pure Javascript nonsense.
There is some front end styling with HTML/CSS, and Inquirer npm package for CLI commands.
This is designed to be a lightweight app but the more I gallavant in the muck, the more fun I appear to have so it may increase in size and scope.  (My bursts of activity and motivation tend to wax and wane with the tides and highly dependent on my latest fixation, so unless the humidity calms down and stops destroying my finger joints, this is my entertainment until I can knit and do origami again.)

## Installation
There are two paths you can take, dear intrepid traveller: using the command line or the front-end.

To run this as a CLI program, first clone this repo down and then run the following command in your terminal: `npm i`, to install necessary dependencies.

Then `npm run start` to begin the program and respond to the prompts in the command line in your terminal.

Once you've completed the prompts, the results will be printed in the console along with a json file or files containing your completed seed data.

>>**NOTE:** I intended this to be a CLI program, since it would be easier to integrate into a backend database. Recommended implementation if you need to test your database or generate larger swaths of data to illustrate your connections/routes.

To access from the front-end, simply open at the live link below; no download necessary!

The results will display on the page and you can copy/paste the results, or re-run it for different results.
